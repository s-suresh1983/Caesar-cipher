A Caesar cipher is a simple encryption technique. The encryption using a Ceasar cipher replaces a letter in the plain text with a letter that is a fixed number down in the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 5 the following substitutions would take place:

a → f
b → g
c → h
…
v → a
w → b
…
z → e
Using this substitutions, a plain text can be encrypted:
